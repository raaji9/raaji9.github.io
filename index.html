    <h1>Hello</h1>
    <h2>Hey I'm Rajaram Parida</h2>
    <h2>and welcome to my personal space</h2>
    <p>I have black hair, I am 5'4", and I weigh 127 pounds. 
        I see myself as the comedian of my friend group. 
        I am shy around people I am not very close with, 
        but once I get to know someone, they can never get me to shut up. 
        I believe others see me as hilarious, smart, caring, and fun to be around. 
        In my free time, I hang out with friends, watch Cricket, sleep, and watch Netflix. 
        My three best friends are Pritik Sha , Aryan Mishra, and Sanket Dash. 
        Unfortunately, I constantly think about what my peers will think of me before I make my decisions. 
        Although, my friends usually help me make wise decisions and give me the confidence to do what is right. 
        My favorite things to eat are pizza, salad, spaghetti, watermelon, and chocolate.
